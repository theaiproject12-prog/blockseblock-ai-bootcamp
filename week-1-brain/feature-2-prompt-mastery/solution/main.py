"""
Feature 2: Prompt Mastery — solution

Adds structured output to the assistant: a new endpoint that classifies the
user's intent, estimates confidence, and returns a rich JSON response instead
of plain text. Feature 1's /api/chat endpoint is kept untouched so both modes
are available simultaneously.

Run this with:
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

Then open http://localhost:8000 to use the chat UI with the Structured Mode
toggle, or http://localhost:8000/docs to explore both endpoints interactively.

- "domain_question": a question specifically about [YOUR_DOMAIN] and its offerings
- "action_request": the user wants something DONE (book, schedule, find, order, send…)
- "unclear": ambiguous, nonsensical, or doesn't fit the other categories

Confidence guidelines:
- 0.9–1.0: you are certain (common knowledge, clear domain fact)
- 0.6–0.8: you are reasonably sure but the user should verify
- 0.3–0.5: you are uncertain; the answer may be incomplete or partly guessed
- 0.0–0.2: you don't know and are mostly guessing
