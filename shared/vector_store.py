"""
Vector store for Feature 5: Find the Answer.

Wraps ChromaDB for persistent, disk-backed chunk embeddings.
Uses Chroma's built-in ONNX embedding function — no external API key
needed. Under the hood: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 producing 384-dimensional vectors.

Unlike session_store.py which resets on every restart, this vector store
persists to disk at VECTOR_DB_PATH — documents you upload survive a
server restart.

Public API:
  get_collection()                              → chromadb.Collection
  add_chunks(document_id, chunks, metadatas)    → None
  search(query, top_k, filters)                 → list[dict]
  delete_document_chunks(document_id)           → None
  get_stats()                                   → dict

    Embed and store document chunks with metadata.

    Chroma auto-embeds the text for us. Under the hood: each chunk becomes
    a 384-dimensional vector using the default all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.
    We never see the numbers — we just hand Chroma the text and it handles
    the conversion.

    IDs are deterministic: "{document_id}_{i}" — so re-uploading the same
    document overwrites its vectors rather than creating duplicates.

      document_id: the Document's UUID from document_store

      metadatas:   parallel list of metadata dicts (filename, chunk_index …)
                   None values are removed — Chroma does not support null metadata.
      tenant_id:   tenant owner (Feature 6 Part B). Stored in metadata so

    """
    Embed the query and return the top_k most similar chunks.

    Distance-to-score conversion:
      Chroma returns L2 distances. We convert to a 0.0–1.0 similarity
      score using:  score = max(0.0, 1.0 - (distance / 2.0))

      This maps:
        distance 0.0 (identical vectors)         → score 1.0
        distance 2.0 (max possible for unit vecs) → score 0.0
      Higher score = more similar. More intuitive than raw distance.

    NOTE — Similarity ≠ Relevance:
      This score measures how close two vector representations are —
      not necessarily how relevant the chunk is to answering the question.
      A chunk can be semantically similar without containing the answer.
      A chunk with the exact answer can score low if it uses different words.

      This is the core limitation of vector RAG ("vibe retrieval").
      Feature 6's Smart Router adds LLM-based reasoning on top of this
      similarity signal. PageIndex (Resource 4) replaces this step entirely
      with reasoning-based retrieval for domains where similarity falls short.

    Args:
      query:     the user's question (embedded using the same model as the chunks)
      top_k:     maximum results to return
      filters:   optional Chroma `where` clause for metadata filtering.
                 {"document_id": "abc"} → search within one document only.
      tenant_id: when ENABLE_MULTI_TENANT=true, restricts results to this tenant.
                 This is the CRITICAL enforcement point for tenant isolation.
                 Filtering at the vector database query level (not application level)
                 means cross-tenant chunks are never even retrieved — a bug cannot
                 leak data because the chunks don't come back at all.

    Returns:
      list of result dicts sorted by score (highest first):
