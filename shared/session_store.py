"""
In-memory session store for the AI Engineering Bootcamp.

This module provides a simple dictionary-based store for conversation sessions.
It is intentionally simple so students can understand the fundamentals before
moving to a database-backed solution.

IMPORTANT — LIMITATION:
  All sessions are lost when the server restarts. This is acceptable for
  development and demos, but not for production. See Resource 3
  (resource/memory-patterns-guide.md in feature-3-ai-memory/) for a comparison
  of memory strategies, including how to swap this out for SQLite or Postgres.

FRAMEWORK EQUIVALENTS (for students exploring LangChain after this course):
  This module is what LangChain calls ConversationBufferMemory.
  The sliding window in main.py (messages[-CONTEXT_WINDOW_SIZE:]) is what
  LangChain calls ConversationBufferWindowMemory.
  See Resource 3 for the full "What You Built vs What Frameworks Call It" table.
